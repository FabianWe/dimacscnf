// Package dimacscnf provides a parser for the simplified DIMACS cnf format.
// This input format is often used in SAT competations or anywhere else where
// cnf formulae are processed.
//
// A more detailed description can be found on http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html
//
// The easiest way to use this package is to use ParseDimacs,
// ParseDimacsWithBounds or ParseDimacsCheck. They all will try to parse
// a cnf from a io.Reader and return the information to you.
// The only difference between them is that they do different checks
// (is the input valid in accordance with the problem line?).
//
// If you know only correct files should be parsed use ParseDimacs, if it is
// important that the specification in the problem line is correct use
// ParseDimacsWithBounds and if it's also important if each variable occurs
// only once in each clause (it is a set without repetitions) and l and Â¬l are
// not allowed in the same clause use ParseDimacsCheck.
//
// These three methods all return the clauses a [][]int, problem 'name'
// (usually "cnf") and nbvar from the problem line.
//
// If you want to create the clauses in a different way you can do that as well:
// Implement DimacsParserHandler and then use ParseGenericDimacs.
